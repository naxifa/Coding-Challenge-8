Employee Management System

 In this project, I will implement an Employee Management System using JavaScript classes to handle employees and departments within a company. iâ€™ll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and methods to create a scalable system. This system will allow us to manage employee details, handle departments, and calculate salaries and bonuses.
