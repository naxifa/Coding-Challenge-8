Employee Management System

 In this project, I will implement an Employee Management System using JavaScript classes to handle employees and departments within a company. iâ€™ll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and methods to create a scalable system. This system will allow us to manage employee details, handle departments, and calculate salaries and bonuses.

What the project does:
1. Store employee information, such as name, position, salary, and department.
2. Store department information, including department name and employees within the department. 
3. Calculate the total salary for a department. 
4. Handle bonuses for specific employees based on their performance. 
5. Allow for different types of employees, such as regular employees and managers, each with unique properties.
